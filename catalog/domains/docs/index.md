## Tanzu Application Platform Accelerator: JupyterLab
This particular accelerator enables the execution of JupyterLab on TAP, significantly boosting its capabilities.

## What is JupyterLab?
JupyterLab is a popular interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data. Widely used within the data science community, JupyterLab supports several languages like Python, R, Julia, and many more. It offers a flexible, adaptable environment that enables you to handle data cleaning, statistical modeling, building and training machine learning models, visualizing data, and many other tasks in a seamless manner.

JupyterLab is not just a notebook, but an entire computational environment that facilitates reproducible research and robust exploratory data analysis. The combination of JupyterLab and TAP will empower your teams to collaborate, share, and produce work in an efficient and streamlined way.

## Objective
The objective of this accelerator is to enable the running of JupyterLab on Tanzu Application Platform. By incorporating JupyterLab into TAP, we aim to provide an enhanced and integrated experience for our users. Users can perform data analysis, run statistical models, and develop machine learning applications, all within the TAP environment. This can make workflows more efficient, encourage data exploration and hypothesis testing, and streamline the process of moving from development to production.
